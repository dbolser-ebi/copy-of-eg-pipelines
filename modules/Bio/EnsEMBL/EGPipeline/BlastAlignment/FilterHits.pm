=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::EGPipeline::BlastAlignment::FilterHits

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Retain the top X hits across a genome, by selecting those with the
best E-value. Note that a single hit might map to multiple locations,
but each of those alignments corresponds to unique protein sequence.
In other words, the 'h' coordinates will not overlap.

EST MAPPING 
============

Here are some more notes concerning the cerevisiae gene load.
One thing to note is that the est exonerate failed to map the ests to the
correct strands because exonerate relies on the sequences having splice sites to
use to predict the strand.
What occured is that several of the sequences were mapped to the +ve strand of
the chromosome, but the hit sequence was mapped on its reverse strand.
In order to corect this I swapped the strands over where the hit was -ve and
the chromsomewas +ve. 
As it turn out this is proboblynot the best way to do this but without splicing
info what are you going to do?
There is a possibilty that any spliced ests that were correcctly mapped to the +
strand would have been flipped to the reverse strand, but as spliced ests are
very rare it shouldnt cause oo much difficulty.
Steve suggested trying to map the ESTS back to the genes they represent, but
this may be rather a lot of work at this stage.


PROTEIN MAPPING
================

Protein mapping was done using wublastx of the genomic vs Uniprot, this resulted
in a large number of spurious hits, possibly due to the lack of repeat masking
of the yeast genome, and also the density of the genes might complicate the
process.
As a result of this I reran the protein mapping using blastgenscanpep but instead 
of using genscan predictions  loaded the genes into the prediction transcrip/exon tables 
to ensure that each gene was blasted against uniprot


ABINITIO GENE PREDICTION
=========================

Genscan has no config for yeast, gene finder is for worm (Steve suggested using
genefinder on the basis that worm is closer to yeast than human. However neither
of them was much use on there own, as they just joined up genes.
Subsequently i Spent some time modifying the config for these programmes to
increase the penalties for making introns.
As a result the predictions look much more like yeaast genes!
The config files that I produced are stored in the config directory ie here!
